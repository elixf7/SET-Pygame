### Introduction
I was recently introduced to the card game SET by a friend and it quickly became one of my favorite card games. However, since most people have been playing since childhood, I could never win a game! SET is all skill and requires quick pattern recognition and practice. I thought the best way to get better was to create the game myself, so I could learn at my own speed, and not have to constantly bug a real player to practice with me. Especially since there were no online versions available that I felt were very similar to the physical card game.

I used the pygame library in python to create this game completely from scratch, with new gamemodes not present in the original card game. These include a **Freeplay** mode, a **Versus** mode, and a **Timed** mode. UI elements are also made from scratch using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, including painstakingly recreating the 81 unique cards since there were not any satifactory equivilents I could find online. 


### How to Play

Below I will explain the basics of how to play SET directly from the [official instructions](https://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf).
